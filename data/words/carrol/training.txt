looking glass house one thing was certain that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it it was the black kittens fault entirely for the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour and bearing it pretty well considering so you see that it couldnt have had any hand in the mischief the way dinah washed her childrens faces was this first she held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw and then with the other paw she rubbed its face all over the wrong way beginning at the nose and just now as i said she was hard at work on the white kitten which was lying quite still and trying to purr no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good but the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon and so while alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great arm chair half talking to herself and half asleep the kitten had been having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted alice had been trying to wind up and had been rolling it up and down till it had all come undone again and there it was spread over the hearth rug all knots and tangles with the kitten running after its own tail in the middle oh you wicked little thing cried alice catching up the kitten and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace really dinah ought to have taught you better manners you ought dinah you know you ought she added looking reproachfully at the old cat and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage and then she scrambled back into the arm chair taking the kitten and the worsted with her and began winding up the ball again but she didnt get on very fast as she was talking all the time sometimes to the kitten and sometimes to herself kitty sat very demurely on her knee pretending to watch the progress of the winding and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball as if it would be glad to help if it might do you know what to morrow is kitty alice began youd have guessed if youd been up in the window with me only dinah was making you tidy so you couldnt i was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfire and it wants plenty of sticks kitty only it got so cold and it snowed so they had to leave off never mind kitty well go and see the bonfire to morrow here alice wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kittens neck just to see how it would look this led to a scramble in which the ball rolled down upon the floor and yards and yards of it got unwound again do you know i was so angry kitty alice went on as soon as they were comfortably settled again when i saw all the mischief you had been doing i was very nearly opening the window and putting you out into the snow and youd have deserved it you little mischievous darling what have you got to say for yourself now dont interrupt me she went on holding up one finger im going to tell you all your faults number one you squeaked twice while dinah was washing your face this morning now you cant deny it kitty i heard you whats that you say pretending that the kitten was speaking her paw went into your eye well thats your fault for keeping your eyes open if youd shut them tight up it wouldnt have happened now dont make any more excuses but listen number two you pulled snowdrop away by the tail just as i had put down the saucer of milk before her what you were thirsty were you how do you know she wasnt thirsty too now for number three you unwound every bit of the worsted while i wasnt looking thats three faults kitty and youve not been punished for any of them yet you know im saving up all your punishments for wednesday week suppose they had saved up all my punishments she went on talking more to herself than the kitten what would they do at the end of a year i should be sent to prison i suppose when the day came or let me see suppose each punishment was to be going without a dinner then when the miserable day came i should have to go without fifty dinners at once well i shouldnt mind that much id far rather go without them than eat them do you hear the snow against the window panes kitty how nice and soft it sounds just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside i wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields that it kisses them so gently and then it covers them up snug you know with a white quilt and perhaps it says go to sleep darlings till the summer comes again and when they wake up in the summer kitty they dress themselves all in green and dance about whenever the wind blows oh thats very pretty cried alice dropping the ball of worsted to clap her hands and i do so wish it was true im sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn when the leaves are getting brown kitty can you play chess now dont smile my dear im asking it seriously because when we were playing just now you watched just as if you understood it and when i said check you purred well it was a nice check kitty and really i might have won if it hadnt been for that nasty knight that came wiggling down among my pieces kitty dear lets pretend and here i wish i could tell you half the things alice used to say beginning with her favourite phrase lets pretend she had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before all because alice had begun with lets pretend were kings and queens and her sister who liked being very exact had argued that they couldnt because there were only two of them and alice had been reduced at last to say well you can be one of them then and ill be all the rest and once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear nurse do lets pretend that im a hungry hyaena and youre a bone but this is taking us away from alices speech to the kitten lets pretend that youre the red queen kitty do you know i think if you sat up and folded your arms youd look exactly like her now do try theres a dear and alice got the red queen off the table and set it up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate however the thing didnt succeed principally alice said because the kitten wouldnt fold its arms properly so to punish it she held it up to the looking glass that it might see how sulky it was and if youre not good directly she added ill put you through into looking glass house how would you like that now if youll only attend kitty and not talk so much ill tell you all my ideas about looking glass house first theres the room you can see through the glass thats just the same as our drawing room only the things go the other way i can see all of it when i get upon a chair all but the bit behind the fireplace oh i do so wish i could see that bit i want so much to know whether theyve a fire in the winter you never can tell you know unless our fire smokes and then smoke comes up in that
