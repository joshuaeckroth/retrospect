room too but that may be only pretence just to make it look as if they had a fire well then the books are something like our books only the words go the wrong way i know that because ive held up one of our books to the glass and then they hold up one in the other room how would you like to live in looking glass house kitty i wonder if theyd give you milk in there perhaps looking glass milk isnt good to drink but oh kitty now we come to the passage you can just see a little peep of the passage in looking glass house if you leave the door of our drawing room wide open and its very like our passage as far as you can see only you know it may be quite different on beyond oh kitty how nice it would be if we could only get through into looking glass house im sure its got oh such beautiful things in it lets pretend theres a way of getting through into it somehow kitty lets pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze so that we can get through why its turning into a sort of mist now i declare itll be easy enough to get through she was up on the chimney piece while she said this though she hardly knew how she had got there and certainly the glass was beginning to melt away just like a bright silvery mist in another moment alice was through the glass and had jumped lightly down into the looking glass room the very first thing she did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace and she was quite pleased to find that there was a real one blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind so i shall be as warm here as i was in the old room thought alice warmer in fact because therell be no one here to scold me away from the fire oh what fun itll be when they see me through the glass in here and cant get at me then she began looking about and noticed that what could be seen from the old room was quite common and uninteresting but that all the rest was as different as possible for instance the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be all alive and the very clock on the chimney piece you know you can only see the back of it in the looking glass had got the face of a little old man and grinned at her they dont keep this room so tidy as the other alice thought to herself as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among the cinders but in another moment with a little oh of surprise she was down on her hands and knees watching them the chessmen were walking about two and two here are the red king and the red queen alice said in a whisper for fear of frightening them and there are the white king and the white queen sitting on the edge of the shovel and here are two castles walking arm in arm i dont think they can hear me she went on as she put her head closer down and im nearly sure they cant see me i feel somehow as if i were invisible here something began squeaking on the table behind alice and made her turn her head just in time to see one of the white pawns roll over and begin kicking she watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next it is the voice of my child the white queen cried out as she rushed past the king so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders my precious lily my imperial kitten and she began scrambling wildly up the side of the fender imperial fiddlestick said the king rubbing his nose which had been hurt by the fall he had a right to be a little annoyed with the queen for he was covered with ashes from head to foot alice was very anxious to be of use and as the poor little lily was nearly screaming herself into a fit she hastily picked up the queen and set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter the queen gasped and sat down the rapid journey through the air had quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing but hug the little lily in silence as soon as she had recovered her breath a little she called out to the white king who was sitting sulkily among the ashes mind the volcano what volcano said the king looking up anxiously into the fire as if he thought that was the most likely place to find one blew me up panted the queen who was still a little out of breath mind you come up the regular way dont get blown up alice watched the white king as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar till at last she said why youll be hours and hours getting to the table at that rate id far better help you hadnt i but the king took no notice of the question it was quite clear that he could neither hear her nor see her so alice picked him up very gently and lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted the queen that she mightnt take his breath away but before she put him on the table she thought she might as well dust him a little he was so covered with ashes she said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face as the king made when he found himself held in the air by an invisible hand and being dusted he was far too much astonished to cry out but his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger and rounder and rounder till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let him drop upon the floor oh please dont make such faces my dear she cried out quite forgetting that the king couldnt hear her you make me laugh so that i can hardly hold you and dont keep your mouth so wide open all the ashes will get into it there now i think youre tidy enough she added as she smoothed his hair and set him upon the table near the queen the king immediately fell flat on his back and lay perfectly still and alice was a little alarmed at what she had done and went round the room to see if she could find any water to throw over him however she could find nothing but a bottle of ink and when she got back with it she found he had recovered and he and the queen were talking together in a frightened whisper so low that alice could hardly hear what they said the king was saying i assure you my dear i turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers to which the queen replied you havent got any whiskers the horror of that moment the king went on i shall never never forget you will though the queen said if you dont make a memorandum of it alice looked on with great interest as the king took an enormous memorandum book out of his pocket and began writing a sudden thought struck her and she took hold of the end of the pencil which came some way over his shoulder and began writing for him the poor king looked puzzled and unhappy and struggled with the pencil for some time without saying anything but alice was too strong for him and at last he panted out my dear i really must get a thinner pencil i cant manage this one a bit it writes all manner of things that i dont intend
